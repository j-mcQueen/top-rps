This project was developed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. 
Check out my [live version](https://j-mcQueen.github.io/top-rps/) of the game.

## About this project

Go 1v1 against the computer in a simple (and colourful) game of Rock, Paper, Scissors! First person to win 5 rounds wins the game. 

In the first iteration of this project, the game was developed to be played inside the browser's console; player choice was retrieved using `prompt()`, and `console.log()` was used to track player and computer scores, as well as output a statement on round and game win/ loss. While functional, playing RPS against the computer isn't a whole lot of fun when you don't have much to interact with, especially for users who don't know what the developer console is, or how to use it!

The second iteration introduced a user-interface to the game to allow the player to choose between Rock, Paper and Scissors by clicking on buttons. Much of the JavaScript had to be refactored to allow this, and the HTML and CSS needed additions to gel everything together.

When I inevitably come back to perfect this project, I plan on refactoring the code again to allow for a more creative game.

## Technologies used

HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What I've learned

- How to animate elements using the `animate()` method (respecting the fact that this is experimental technology),
- Developed my understanding of how function parameters are used and the scope of their application,
- Developed my understanding of DOM manipulation, and how they can be used alongside loops like `forEach()`,
- Developed my ability to problem solve and to break problems down
